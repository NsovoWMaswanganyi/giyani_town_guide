            <h2>History</h2>
            
                <p>
                    Giyani was established during the 1960s as the capital city of Gazankulu, on land belonging to the Homu Royal Family.[4] The Risinga Community (under headman Chabalala) originally came from the Elim district, next to the township of Waterval.

                    The Old Parliament Buildings in Giyani, the ministerial houses, and the Palace of the chief minister of Gazankulu were built on what used to be the Chief's Kraal and headquarters of the Risinga Community. Across the main road, the Risinga Community used to drive their herds of cattle for grazing at a place known today as Giyani Golf Course. Giyani Section E, Section A, Sections D1 and D2, and the CBD of Giyani, known as Bendstore, were villages of the Risinga Community. The Risinga Community was forcefully removed from their land during the 1960s[5] in order to make way for the new capital of Gazankulu, and they were relocated to the foothills of Man'ombe Mountain in Homu Block 14 and Makoxa Village with their chief, Hosi Homu Chabalala.[5]
                </p>

            <h2>Culture</h2>

            <p>
                Most residents of Giyani speak Xitsonga[6] as their first language. The Tsonga women perform the xibelani dance[7]'and called the dance Xigaza, while the men enjoy mpuluto and makhwaya. The Tsonga people also engage in a custom dance called mchongolo. Xibelani is an African skirt designed to make the wearer's hips look bigger so that the hip movement during the xibelani dance can be more apparent. The Tsonga people have their own distinct music when the xibelani dance is performed.

                The staple diet in Giyani is maize porridge (vuswa or pap in Afrikaans) and rice, often eaten with meat, chicken, and vegetables (matsavu).

                "Giyani" is one of the tracks on the album Third World Child by Johnny Clegg and his band Savuka, written about leaving the stress of Johannesburg to get some peace and quiet in Giyani.[8]
            </p>

            <h2>Climate</h2>
                <p>
                    Giyani is situated within the sub-tropical zone.[9] It can be very hot in the summer, reaching a maximum temperature of 41 °C in the summer and 25 °C during the winter. Winters are mild during the day and cold during the night.

                    The rainy season is between September and March, while the winter season is from April to August.
                </p>


            <h2>Economy</h2>

                <p>
                    Giyani's economy is predominately rural-based. Cattle ranching and the production of maize, peanuts, tomatoes, potatoes, mangoes, and bananas form the backbone of agriculture.[11] With the economic boom, Giyani has now become a major retail and entertainment center for the local population. Modern shopping centers, with all the well-known chain stores presented, have vastly uplifted the local trade.[12]
                </p>

            <h2>Tourism</h2>

                <p>
                    Giyani's location is in the warm African bushveld, which makes it attractive for both local and international visitors. The Giyani Golf Course is home to zebras, giraffes, bushbucks, and some other herbivores; however, the viewing of these animals has not yet been commercialized.

                    At the moment, there are a number of bed and breakfast and guest house facilities for tourists. A few are: Hanyani Lodge, Riverside Guest House, Xisaka Bed and Breakfast, Tihosi Guest House, Elridge Mountain Lodge, Rosanna Guest House, Nwayitelo Lodge, and Mopani Guest House.

                    Limpopo Lodge (formerly Giyani Hotel) is situated in the center of town and managed by the Oasis Group. Man'ombe Nature Reserve is located 6 km east of Giyani.

                    Giyani also borders Kruger National Park on the western side of the Northern Region. Historically, Giyani had no entry point to Kruger National Park, even though Giyani shares a long border with Kruger National Park. There was a plan to open a new gate, known as Shangoni Gate, at Muyexe Village, 30 km north-east of Giyani town. This gate was supposed to bring much-needed development to the nearby villages of Muyexe, Mahonisi, and Mtititi, where unemployment is 80%.[21] These villages have been historically poor, despite the fact that they border one of the world's best safari destinations.
